# jack-analyzer
Nand2Tetris project, building a tokenizer and analyzer.

##Jack Tokenizer
A tokenizer is used to break down the source code of a program into basic units called tokens.

##Jack Parser / Compilation Engine
- An analyzer grabs tokens to check the grammar of the code and produce a structured representation (in XML)
- This confirms the code follows Jackâ€™s syntax rules: class structure, subroutines, statements, expressions, terms, etc. Before moving on to the generation of VM code.
